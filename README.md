# funcVBA (primarily for Excel)

This is a toolkit of different functions, class modules, and other general useful snippets of code that I've created overtime to use primarily in Excel, though there are some helpful commands for running command line Windows batch with commonly used tools.

All the VBA functions are stored in the VBA folder. Toolkits that are ready to be dragged and dropped into your project all start with  the `z_` prefix. Other files are typically useful only for reference for certain VBA functions. Code borrowed from other places on the web has been attributed whenever possible.
